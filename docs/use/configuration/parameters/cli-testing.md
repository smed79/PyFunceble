# `cli_testing`

This is where you can configure everything related to the testing through the CLI.

## Overview

```yaml title=".PyFunceble.overwrite.yaml"
cli_testing:
  # Provides everything directly related to the testing through the CLI.

  # Set the IP to prefix each hosts file lines with.
  #
  # CLI Argument: -ip | --hosts-ip
  hosts_ip: "0.0.0.0"

  # Set the amount of maximal workers to use to perform tests.
  #
  # NOTE:
  #     If set to `null`, the value is implicitly CPU * Cores - 2
  #
  # CLI Argument: -w | --max-workers
  max_workers: null

  # Enable/Disable the autocontinue datasets.
  #
  # The autocontinue datasets/database is a database that temporarily store the
  # result of the tested subject in the hope to continue as soon as possible
  # after a break or shortage.
  #
  # CLI Argument: -c | --auto-continue | --continue
  autocontinue: no

  # Enable/Disable the inactive datasets.
  #
  # The inactive datasets/database is used to store the INACTIVE and INVALID
  # subjects to purposely retest then at a later time.
  #
  # This mechanism let you cleanup your source file while being sure that
  # pyfunceble will retest the old entries of your source file. After retesting,
  # pyfunceble will throw the newly ACTIVE subject from the database and put
  # it into your ACTIVE output files so that you can reintroduce them into
  # your list.
  #
  # CLI Argument:  --inactive-db
  inactive_db: yes

  # Enable/Disable the whois storage of whois records.
  #
  # This mechanism let us avoid spaming the WHOIS servers by storing the
  # expiration dates from the whois record into a local datasets/database.
  # Later on, PyFunceble will query the local database first.
  #
  # CLI Argument: -wdb | --whois-database
  whois_db: yes

  # Enable/Disable the testing and generation of complements.
  #
  # A complement is `www.example.org` when `example.org` is given and vice-versa.
  #
  # CLI Argument: --complements
  complements: no

  # Enable/Disable the expension and testing of single addresses of a CIDR.
  #
  # CLI Argument: --cidr
  cidr_expand: no

  # Set the cooldown time to apply between each tests.
  #
  # This is essential to avoid spaming remote resources - especially WHOIS servers.
  #
  # WARNING:
  #     This must be a value >= 0.0
  #
  # CLI Argument: --cooldown-time
  cooldown_time: 0.0

  # Sets the Database Connector type to use.
  # Available: csv | mariadb | mysql | postgresql
  #
  # Set the type of database to use or generate to store long term information-s.
  #
  # When set to `mariadb`, `mysql` or `postgesql` the following environment
  # variables are required.
  #
  #     PYFUNCEBLE_DB_HOST - The host or unix socket path of the database server.
  #     PYFUNCEBLE_DB_PORT - The port to use to reach the database server.
  #     PYFUNCEBLE_DB_USERNAME - The username to use to connect to the database server - when applicable.
  #     PYFUNCEBLE_DB_PASSWORD - The password to use to connect to the database server - when applicable.
  #     PYFUNCEBLE_DB_NAME - The name of the database to work with.
  #     PYFUNCEBLE_DB_CHARSET - The charset to use - when applicable.
  #
  # Available Values: csv | mariadb | mysql | postgresql
  #
  # CLI Argument: --database-type
  db_type: csv

  # Set the filter to apply while reading inputs.
  #
  # In other words, a global filter to apply to select the subject to tests.
  # Meaning that if you give `\.info$` (for example), we will only test the
  # subjects that ends with `.info`.
  #
  # CLI Argument: --filter
  file_filter: null

  # Enable/Disable the mining of subjects.
  #
  # When enabled, PyFunceble will follow the HTTP redirects and put all redirected
  # subjects into the testing queue and outputs.
  #
  # CLI Argument: --mining
  mining: no

  # Acknowledge/Dismiss that we are testing for subjects that are only on the
  # local network.
  #
  # NOTE:
  #     When enabled, no syntax checking will be processed when performing
  #     availability and reputation tests.
  #
  # CLI Argument: --local
  local_network: no

  # Enable/Disable the preloading of the given input file(s).
  #
  # When enabled, we take the time to pre-load subjects by decoding inputs files
  # and storing the informatino in the chosen datasets/database format.
  # The hope is to optimise some of our process by only focusing on testing.
  #
  # WARNING:
  #     While this is helpful for long running tasks, this might not be a good
  #     idea if you are testing a URL directly. This process is not optimizied
  #     for sources that are constantly updated (checksums).
  #
  # CLI Argument: --preload
  preload_file: no

  # Enable/Disable a chancy testing mode that unleashes and bypass the safety
  # workflow-s in place in hope of speed.
  #
  # DANGER / WARNING:
  #     You have been warned. This mode is for the chancy and lucky one.
  #
  #     You shouldn't use this unless you fele really, really, really lucky and
  #     trust your machine.
  #
  #     Enabling this mode makes thinks look 'fast', but it may produce some
  #     rather ... unexpected behavior and results - IF N+1 process simultaneously
  #     write the same output file.
  #
  #     This mode also makes the CLI terminal output unparsable - either.
  #
  #     **MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!**
  #
  # CLI Argument: --chancy
  chancy_tester: no

    # CI engine.
    #
    #       GIT_NAME - The `git.name` to setup and use.

    #
    # Dots !? Why Dots ? WTH ?!
    #   Yes, you read correctly dots. Those dots are crutial under CI/CD engines
    #   that assumes that no-output within a few minutes is an error. To avoid
    #   such situation when the CI/CD engines just kill the job, we print dots,
    #   when we perform some tasks that may not output anything for a few minutes.
    #
    #   An example is when you are on the second session of testing and PyFunceble
    #   is going through the list of subjects but it sees that the subject has been
    #   already tested.

    #
    # Analytic ?! WTH !?
    #   Yes, analytic! While PyFunceble is really good for a lot of things, sometime
    #   it takes some decision without being really sure about it or without
    #   wanting to be biased. Therefore, it generates files inside the analytic folder.
    #   The files inside the analytic folder are there for human to analyse or
    #   to invite the community to influence PyFunceble.
    #
    #   If you are sure that the behavior of PyFunceble should be adopted for sure,
    #   fill an issue and let's evolve it together :-)
